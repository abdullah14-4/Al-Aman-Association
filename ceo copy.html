        <p>She was born in 1957, in a family that cares the most about educating their children and boosting their</p>
        <p>capabilities. She and her sister was blind, therefore, it was difficult for them to pursue their education in</p>
        <p>Yemen at that time. So, they moved to Egypt and there Fatima started her difficult path until she gained a</p>
        <p>Degree in Philosophy. Now, the time to reap (the fruits of her efforts) and participate in the labor has come</p>
        <p>Her father offered her a job with him, but she chose charitable works instead. She started her work as a</p>
        <p>social specialist at Al-Noor Institute for Blind Women in Cairo and she was a giving-person and exerted all</p>
        <p>efforts for six long years until the time to return home was inevitable. It was a moment when the dawn of</p>
        <p>hope emerged, and the birth of Yemeni blind women light had born. That was the time of sowing the seeds</p>
        <p>and Al-Noor Center was established. Later, the Yemeni Blind Organization was established and Fatima held a</p>
        <p>number of positions and performed many roles. She, through her roles, discovered the blind women need to</p>
        <p>create their own world, where they grow up peacefully and securely in order to proceed with confidence and determination.</p>
